     * 528. Random Pick with Weight
     *  Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of index i(0-indexed),
     *  write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.
     *
     *
     *  For example, given an input list of values w = [2, 8],
     *  when we pick up a number out of it, the chance is that 8 times out of 10
     *  we should pick the number 1 as the answer since it's the second element of the array (w[1] = 8).
